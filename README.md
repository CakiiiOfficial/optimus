# optimus-run
A simple shell wrapper which aims for convinient way of running games.

NVIDIA prime-run was in my case really crappy so I thought to myself, why not make a simple script that did render offloading that prime-run was supposed to do and also apply optimizations for good performance?
Note: This page may not be up to date with the script, so keep that in mind.

# optimus-kill
Another simple shell script which aims to kill gamescope and/or gamemode if they linger for too long in the background.
